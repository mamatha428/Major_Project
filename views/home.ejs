          <h2>About Project</h2>
          <p>
            Online predators try to gradually seduce their targets through attention,
            affection, kindness, and even gifts, and often devote considerable time, money,
            and energy to this effort. They are aware of the latest music and hobbies likely
            to interest kids. They listen to and sympathize with kids' problems. They also try
            to ease young people's inhibitions by gradually introducing sexual content into
            their conversations or by showing them sexually explicit material.
          </p>

            <strong>Desired Solution:</strong> The solution will detect suspect profiles based
            on child grooming behavior patterns, hate speech provokers, stalking and bullying
            mentality profiles, and explicit content explorers (postings, comments) on social
            media platforms and other websites.
